<h2>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</h2>
HTML is cool
CSS is cooler
JS is the best

<h2>
  <em>What do you need to create a website?</em>
</h2>

Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files

Follow my progress on github
